# Agent-Orchestration Framework using LangChain  
### Full Project Overview (Milestones 1–4)

This project focuses on building an intelligent **multi-agent orchestration system** using LangChain.  
The system supports planning, tool usage, memory, collaboration, and workflow automation through agents.

Below is the complete overview of **all milestones**, including objectives, tasks, and final expected outputs.

---

# 📍 Milestone 1 – Environment Setup & Basic Agent Creation

### 🎯 Goal  
Lay the foundation by setting up the environment and creating a simple LangChain agent.

### 🔧 What was done  
- Python + LangChain environment setup  
- Connected Gemini model (`ChatGoogleGenerativeAI`)  
- Implemented `PromptTemplate` + `LLMChain`  
- Created a console-based interactive agent  
- Added custom markdown-to-CLI color parser  

### 📦 Output  
- Functional LangChain environment  
- Basic single-agent chat prototype  
- Console interface for testing  

---

# 📍 Milestone 2 – Tool Integration & API Calling

### 🎯 Goal  
Give the agent the ability to use tools and perform actions.

### 🔧 What will be done  
- Implement LangChain `Tool` abstraction  
- Add at least 2 tools (e.g., Calculator, Fake Weather API)  
- Write prompts enabling tool invocation  
- Handle tool errors and invalid requests  

### 📦 Expected Output  
- Agent capable of using external tools  
- At least two working tool integrations  
- Verified tool-agent interaction  

---

# 📍 Milestone 3 – Multi-Agent Orchestration & Memory Management

### 🎯 Goal  
Build multiple agents that communicate and use memory intelligently.

### 🔧 What will be done  
- Define agent roles (e.g., Researcher, Summarizer)  
- Enable conversation between agents  
- Add **individual memory** (ConversationBufferMemory)  
- Add **shared memory** (VectorStoreRetrieverMemory)  
- Orchestrate a collaborative multi-step scenario  

### 📦 Expected Output  
- Multi-agent system working together  
- Functional memory layers (personal + shared)  
- Collaborative task execution flow  

---

# 📍 Milestone 4 – Complex Workflow Automation, REST API & UI

### 🎯 Goal  
Expose the multi-agent workflow as an automated service with API + UI.

### 🔧 What will be done  
- Design a real workflow  
  - e.g., “Research → Summarize → Compose Email”  
- Implement multi-agent orchestration logic  
- Build a REST API using FastAPI/Flask  
- Develop a basic frontend (HTML/JS or Streamlit)  
- Documentation, cleanup, and testing  

### 📦 Expected Output  
- Complete automated workflow  
- REST API endpoints for triggering flows  
- Interactive web UI  
- Final documentation & evaluation

# 📘 Evaluation Criteria (All Milestones)

| Milestone | Requirement | Evaluation |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| **1** | Basic agent setup | Agent responds to prompts |
| **2** | Tool usage | Agent successfully calls tools |
| **3** | Multi-agent + memory | Agents collaborate using memory |
| **4** | Complex automation | API + UI + workflow completed |

# ✅ Final Deliverables of Entire Project

- Multi-agent LangChain system  
- Tool-enabled intelligent agents  
- Memory-powered collaboration  
- Workflow automation pipeline  
- REST API + frontend interface  
- Documentation for all modules
